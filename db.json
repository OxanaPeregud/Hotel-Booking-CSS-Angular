They offer complementary fruit, chocolates and coffee in the room. Breakfast is good and you can choose: Indian, continental, etc. Also the restaurant is very good and reasonably priced. Overall the experience was brilliant and enjoyed or weekend getaway a lot. I will definitely stay there again.",
